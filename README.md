FOR THE FINAL:

The final code is contained within final/Final_Project_Adam_Friday-copy.ipynb
15 minute timestep data is in final/TRAIN and final/TEST
1 hour timestep data is in final/HOUR_TRAIN and final/HOUR_TEST

These need to be located in the same directory as the jupyter notebook in order to run. Several of the plots were generated with code that is commented out in the final run, but simple changes to variable names yield all plots and data that were generated by me.
